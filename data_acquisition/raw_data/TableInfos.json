DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS\r\n\r\nDefinitions:\r\n\r\nCompensation of employees\r\nCompensation of employees is the total remuneration paid by employers to their employees in return for work done. Compensation of employees is classified in wages and salaries and employers' social contributions.\r\n\r\nWages and salaries\r\nWages and salaries include income taxes and employees' social contributions even if they are actually withheld by the employer and paid directly to tax authorities, social security schemes and pension schemes. Besides wages that are periodically and directly paid to employees, wages and salaries also contain wages in kind and holiday allowances. Furthermore, certain refunds for costs made by the employee are included as well.\r\n\r\nEmployers' social contributions\r\nEmployers' social contributions consist of payments to insurers made by employers for the benefit of their employees. They can be classified in employers' social security contributions, employers' private social contributions (of which pension schemes) and the imputed social contributions.\r\n\r\nWage costs\r\nThe total of wages, social contributions paid by employers and taxes on wage costs minus wage cost subsidies.\r\n\r\nEmployee\r\nA person who has a contract with an economic unit to carry out work in return for financial remuneration.\r\n\r\nJobs\r\nA job is an explicit or implicit employment contract between a person and an economic unit which specifies that labour will be carried out in return for (financial) remuneration.\r\n\r\nFull-time equivalent (fte)\r\nA measure of labour volume, calculated by converting all full-time and part-time jobs to full-time jobs.\r\n\r\nHours worked\r\nThe number of hours actually worked by someone with a paid job.\r\n\r\nHours paid\r\nThe sum of the hours agreed and the paid extra hours.\r\n\r\nSeasonal correction\r\nThe removal of annually recurring patterns from the figures which are normal for a particular time of year.\r\n\r\nStandard Industrial Classification 2008 (SIC 2008):\r\nThe Dutch hierarchic classification of economic activities is used by Statistics Netherlands to classify private sector entities by main activity. The SIC 2008 is the version used since 2008.\r\n\r\n“Sector of industry” or “branch” is the common term used to define businesses sharing the same main activity. \r\nStatistics Netherlands uses the classification by main activity, the so-called Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Businesses in a sector of industry or branch may also be engaged in other activities (subsidiary activities).\r\nThe SIC 2008 includes various levels indicated by a maximum of five digits. The four-digits level corresponds to the classification employed by the European Union (NACE). The first two digits correspond to the United Nations classification (ISIC).\r\n\r\nExplanation of symbols:\r\n\r\nEmpty cell\t: figure not applicable\r\n. \t\t: figure is unknown, insufficiently reliable or confidential\r\n*\t\t: provisional figure \r\n**\t\t: revised provisional figure\r\n\r\n3.
